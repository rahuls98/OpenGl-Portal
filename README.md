# OpenGl-Portal
A C/C++ project using the OpenGL library and API's to depict a Portal system
with multiple configurations; including user and object teleportation

## Room 1 
- Room 1 involves user teleportation. 
- The goal is to collect the teapot placed across a chasm. Trying to cross the chasm will lead to the user falling from the room to his/her death. 
- The only way to safely collect the teapot is to use the portal to cross the chasm.
